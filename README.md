# Jonathan Bolbynsky now in Discord !

Yes, you heard it ; Jonathan is now in Discord. Because I wanted to find an excuse for not working on Aced Beyond in the meanwhile.

All the 3 Rooms of Gaiana fans are gonna be happy with that !

## What is this bot used for ?

Well…
- You can play some games with him
- He can give you tips & fun facts on random stuff
- I don't even know this repo ain't even taking itself seriously

## Will this bot receive 24/7 hosting ?

I'm trying to do it via Wispbyte & similar services (but mostly Wispbyte for now).

## Will you ever work on Rooms of Gaiana again ?

Fuh nah 💔

Wait for Aced Beyond instead idk

## Can I steal your bot's code to make my own ?

I guess you can as long as it's credited. Read the license for more info.
